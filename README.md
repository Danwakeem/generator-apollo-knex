> A Generator for a simple apollo server integrated with knex

I should point out this was inspired by the [apollo-typescript-starter](https://github.com/kylealwyn/apollo-typescript-starter). There are a few changes I made to this config vs. the original but thought it would be nice to have a generator around this.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-apollo-knex using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-apollo-knex
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo apollo-knex
```

This project configures Knex with `postgres` out of the box but you can change this by installing a compatible [Knex `npm`](http://knexjs.org/#Installation-client) database package and adding the `DATABASE_CLIENT` name to the `.env` file.

### Generating a new schema
This generator also includes a CLI to create a new graphql schema that will automatically get picked up by the server.

To generate a new schema run and follow the prompts:

```bash
yo apollo-knex:schema
```

**Important:** This doesn't not create a new Knex migrate file for you. If the new schema you are creating is supposed to link up with your database, then follow the [db migration pattern in Knex](http://knexjs.org/#Migrations).

> There is a script in the `package.json` file for you project that will allow you to run knex commands without installing knex globally. Example: `npm run knex migrate:make migration_name`

 ## Project structure
